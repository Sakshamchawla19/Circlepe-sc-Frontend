**Prerequisites**

Before embarking on your CirclePe frontend development journey, ensure your local machine possesses the following essential tools:

- **Node.js (v14 or later):**  The cornerstone of modern JavaScript development, Node.js provides a robust runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the confines of a web browser. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Package Manager (npm or Yarn):**  Node.js comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager), a command-line tool that streamlines the installation and management of JavaScript packages (libraries or modules) required by your project. However, if you prefer an alternative, Yarn is an excellent choice. Installation instructions for both are readily available online:
    - npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - Yarn: [https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   To obtain a local copy of the CirclePe-Frontend codebase, leverage the Git version control system by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sakshamchawla19/Circlepe-sc-Frontend.git
   ```

   This command will establish a local replica of the CirclePe-Frontend repository on your machine.

**Additional Instructions for Setting Up the CirclePe-Frontend Project locally on your system:**

**1. Navigate to the Project Directory:**

- Open your terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` command to change directories to the cloned CirclePe-Frontend repository:

   ```bash
   cd Circlepe-sc-Frontend
   ```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

- To install the necessary JavaScript packages specified in the project's `package.json` file, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This will download and install all the required dependencies for the frontend project to function correctly.

**3. Start the Development Server:**

- Once the dependencies are installed, you can start a local development server to preview the frontend application. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or, if using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   The development server will typically run on port 3000 by default. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

**4. Make Changes and Test:**

- Now you can modify the frontend code within the `src` directory to customize the application's behavior and appearance. Save your changes and refresh the browser to see the updates reflected.

**5. Build for Production:**

- When you're ready to deploy the application, create a production-ready build using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Or, if using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

   This will generate a optimized and minified version of the frontend code in the `build` directory.

**6. Deploy the Application:**

- You can deploy the built frontend code to a web server (like a static hosting service) to make it accessible to users. Refer to the specific deployment instructions provided by your chosen hosting provider.
