**Prerequisites**

Before embarking on your CirclePe frontend development journey, ensure your local machine possesses the following essential tools:

- **Node.js (v14 or later):**  The cornerstone of modern JavaScript development, Node.js provides a robust runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the confines of a web browser. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Package Manager (npm or Yarn):**  Node.js comes bundled with npm (Node Package Manager), a command-line tool that streamlines the installation and management of JavaScript packages (libraries or modules) required by your project. However, if you prefer an alternative, Yarn is an excellent choice. Installation instructions for both are readily available online:
    - npm: [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    - Yarn: [https://yarnpkg.com/](https://yarnpkg.com/)

**Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
